# Extended Feature Document - Corrections Summary

## Date: June 11, 2025

This document summarizes the critical corrections made to `backend/extended_feature.md` to ensure accuracy and alignment with the actual codebase implementation.

## Major Issues Corrected

### 1. **Database Schema Mismatches** ‚ùå‚û°Ô∏è‚úÖ
**Problem**: Document claimed advanced database features were implemented that didn't exist.

**Corrections Made**:
- Updated database schema section to clearly distinguish between "Current Schema (As Implemented)" vs "Planned Schema Enhancements"
- Corrected zone table documentation - removed false claims about `enabled`, `threshold` fields in database
- Clarified that some features (zone enabled/threshold) are currently handled in-memory only
- Fixed alarm table documentation to match basic current implementation vs planned advanced features

### 2. **Frontend Technology Confusion** ‚ùå‚û°Ô∏è‚úÖ
**Problem**: Document referenced Vue.js components but project uses React + MUI.

**Corrections Made**:
- Changed all `.vue` component references to generic React component names
- Updated all "Frontend" sections to indicate React + MUI technology
- Removed specific Vue.js syntax and patterns
- Added clarification that no frontend currently exists (all frontend tasks are planned)

### 3. **Inaccurate Implementation Status** ‚ùå‚û°Ô∏è‚úÖ
**Problem**: Features marked as "implemented" were actually only stubs or basic implementations.

**Corrections Made**:

| Feature | Old Status | New Status | Reality |
|---------|------------|------------|---------|
| Zone Management DB persistence | ‚úÖ Implemented | üìã Planned | Only in-memory |
| Alarm System | ‚úÖ Implemented | ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic only | Basic threshold checking |
| Notifications | ‚úÖ DB schema done | üìã Planned | Only logging stubs |
| Event Storage | ‚úÖ Implemented | ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic framework | Basic schema only |

### 4. **Added Status Clarity** ‚ûï
**Added at document top**:
- Clear status legend explaining what "implemented", "planned", "basic only" mean
- Warning that frontend components are planned for React + MUI
- Note that no frontend currently exists

### 5. **Feature Description Accuracy** ‚ùå‚û°Ô∏è‚úÖ
**Updated feature descriptions** to accurately reflect current implementation state:
- Zone Management: Clarified API implemented, frontend planned
- Alarm System: Basic threshold checking vs advanced features planned
- Notifications: Logging stubs vs full implementation planned
- Database: Basic PRAGMA settings vs full backup/restore planned

## Test Verification ‚úÖ

Ran full test suite to verify documented "implemented" features actually work:
```
============================================= 21 passed in 3.84s ==============================================
```

All tests pass, confirming the accuracy of features marked as "implemented".

## Current Project Status

### ‚úÖ **Actually Implemented & Working**
- Basic thermal sensor API (`/api/v1/thermal/real-time`)
- Zone management API (GET/POST/DELETE `/api/v1/zones`)
- Zone average calculation (`/api/v1/zones/{id}/average`)
- System health monitoring (`/api/v1/health`)
- Basic alarm threshold checking (in-memory)
- Database connectivity with PRAGMA optimization
- Comprehensive test coverage (21 passing tests)

### üìã **Planned/Not Yet Implemented**
- Frontend (React + MUI components)
- Advanced alarm features (debounce, acknowledgment, history)
- Notification system (email, SMS, webhook)
- Historical data export and analytics
- Database backup/restore/migration
- Event frame storage and retrieval
- Settings management API

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Basic Implementation Only**
- Event-triggered frame storage (framework exists)
- Alarm system (basic threshold checking)
- Database schema (basic tables, needs enhancement)

## Document Structure Improvements

1. **Added Implementation Status Disclaimer** at document top
2. **Corrected Database Schema Section** with current vs planned
3. **Updated Changelog** to reflect corrections
4. **Maintained Existing Structure** while fixing inaccuracies

## Verification

The corrected document now accurately reflects:
- ‚úÖ What's actually implemented and tested
- üìã What's planned for future development
- ‚ö†Ô∏è What exists in basic form but needs enhancement
- üîß What technology stack is actually being used (React, not Vue)

This ensures stakeholders have accurate expectations and developers have reliable documentation.
